# Budget Tracker Starter Code
This is part of Challenge 19 - PWA Budget Tracker App for my UT Bootcamp Full Stack Program

## Built With
This application was built with starter code from my UT Bootcamp, PWA Manifest, MongoAtlas, and Deployed to Heroku.

## Contributions
This was largely an independent project. I worked with my Tutor on some of the console errors that we had. I steady on have syntax errors because I'm rushing and that isn't a good thing. It will be something I need to work on. I spent too much time fixing cahce to cache.
